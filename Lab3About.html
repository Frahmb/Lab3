            A little about me</h1></header>

        <p id="first_paragraph" class="class_paragraph" style=" font-size:25px; ">
            I was born on October 19th, 1994. I grew up in a small town in south eastern Idaho named Notus. After graduating from Notus, 
            I went on to the College of Idaho in 2013 to study Health Science and play on the football team. I attended CofI for 2 years 
            before I took a hiatus from school. I then went back to the College of Western Idaho in 2018 where I finished my Health Science 
            degree in 2020. It was at this point I decided to change my degree to Computer Science and attend the University of Idaho. I am 
            currently a senior expected to graduate in 2023 from the University of Idaho.
